# Git Goat Path for Live Instruction

this is material for the after the [shell intro](https://github.com/UA-Carpentries-Workshops/2019-02-23-WorkshopResources/blob/master/shell-lessons/1_intro-to-shell.md) for feb 2019 workshop

[intro stuff]

navigate to GitHub repository folder
```{sh}
pwd #/SDC_02-23-2019/repository/data/processed_data
cd ../../..
pwd #/SDC_02-23-2019
cd 2019-02-23-WorkshopResources/shell-lessons/data/gapminder_data/gapminder_by_country/
```

fix a mistake - colleague told us about it
```{sh}
nano Argentina.cc.txt 
# change 1952 to 1954
# save file
```

want to remember that we've made this change
how?[get suggestions]
have computer do it for us using git
- don't have to copy and save files with different names
- won't lose any previous versions

how to do this
```{sh}
git status
```
do this command a lot
just tells you what's going on
tells us that we changed a file! 
"Changes not staged for commit"
haven't been staged or commited
will do this next

2 part process
step 1: 
add file to the stage
```{sh}
git add Argentina.cc.txt 
git status
```
check out to see what happened
green text means staged
stage what we have changed

step 2: 
commit staged file
"save" what we have changed
```{sh}
git commit #don't execute
git commit -m #an option that means we leave a message
git commit -m "Fix date error in Argentina file" #include descriptive message of change
```

how do we see our history of changes? 
```{sh}
git status #nothing there has changed since
git log
```
most recent commit (ours) is at top
can see previous commits to this repo
arrow keys to scroll
q to exit

let's do it again! 
we're going to make another change to files in this local repo
copy file and change its name
```{sh}
cat Vietnam.cc.txt
```
what's the command for copying? 
what are arguments? 
```{sh}
cp Vietnam.cc.txt Vietnam_recent.cc.txt
```

what does git say? 
```{sh}
git status
```
untracked file
first was modified file bc already committed changes to it before
this is a new file

same process for saving record of change
what is step 1? 
what is step 2? 
```{sh}
git add Vietname_recent.cc.txt
git commit -m "Create copy of Vietnam file"
git status
git log
```

one more time
third time's a charm! 
only interested in data post-2000 for vietname
how do we do this? 
```{sh}
cat Vietnam_recent.cc.txt
tail -2 Vietnam_recent.cc.txt 
tail -2 Vietnam_recent.cc.txt >> Vietnam_recent.cc.txt 
cat Vietnam_recent.cc.txt 
```

save this new version of the file
also keep previous verions
```{sh}
git status
git add Vietname_recent.cc.txt
git commit -m "Subset Vietnam file to post-2000"
git status
git log
```

now we have our files and a record of their changes
trapped on our personal computer
what if we want to share them?
what if we want to save them online? 

[navigate in finder to file]
this is local repository
on personal computer
all we've done is git

can also look at files and versions online
[open up forked repo in browser]
this is the remote repository
they are linked
[click on commits]
the remote repo is out of date
older commits only
none of three new ones

[back to command line]
git command for this
```{sh}
git push
```
[reload page]
there they are! 
click on most recent to look at it
show which file was changed and how

push frequently
at least once a day
or after every commit

foundational workflow of git and github
change files locally
save those changes
update remote repo with changes
